# POWER-BI-E-COMMERCE-SALES-PROJECT

I’m excited to share that I’ve created another impressive dashboard for e-commerce sales using Power BI. This dashboard leverages insights derived from two linked Excel sheets: Orders Data and Details Data.

Orders Data includes:

Order ID
Order Date
Customer Name
State
City
Details Data includes:

Order ID
Amount
Profit
Quantity
Category
Sub-Category
Payment Mode


I’ve cleaned and linked these two datasets to uncover various insights, such as:

Sales by State
Sales by Customer
Payment Mode Analysis
Sales Quantity and Category
Profit by Month
Profit by Category


These insights are designed to help enhance profitability and make data-driven decisions.
